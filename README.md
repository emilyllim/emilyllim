Hello, my name is Emily! I recently graduated with my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** from **Washington State University Vancouver**, and have participated in two fellowships. During the **Production Engineering fellowship**, I had the opportunity to explore the capabilities of **DevOps** through hands-on experiences (including the creation and maintenance of my portfolio!). As part of the **Software Engineering fellowship**, I explored open source projects and assisted in initiatives to enhance Python performance. These experiences have fueled my passion to troubleshoot and solve real-world challenges that will make a difference in the world.

With my strong foundation in **Software Engineering** and **DevOps** concepts obtained through relevant coursework and previous work experiences, I am actively seeking a new opportunity to contribute and grow my skills, while working within a fast-paced, collaborative professional environment.
